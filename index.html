						<p>
							Lesbian spaces are disappearing everywhere. Madrona is not just a bar or a café. It is a community space.
							You are not just funding renovations.
							You are helping build a space that many of us have been missing for a long time.
							We have 5 months to raise €35,000 to complete these works and make the space operational.
							Without this funding, the project cannot move forward.<br />

								<h3>Help Us Open Laise Bien 💖</h3>
								<p>

									Laise Bien is a non-profit project to open a lesbian, feminist community space in Brussels.
									Think: coffee by day, drinks later, feminist books everywhere, good conversations, soft lighting, and zero tolerance for nonsense.
									We found a space.
									It is… extremely empty.
									Like, no toilets empty. “Electricity doing whatever it wants” empty. So before we can welcome you in, we need to make it legally, safely, and humanly usable.
									What we need money for
									To open Laise Bien, we need to fund the very glamorous essentials:
									Installing toilets (because society insists on this)
									Fixing and conforming the electricity
									Internet and basic infrastructure
									Making the space safe and up to code
									Not exciting, but absolutely necessary if we want to open the doors and keep them open.
									The goal:
									We have 5 months to raise €35,000.
									That money goes directly into turning an empty shell into a real, functioning, welcoming space.

										Why MADRONA
										Lesbian spaces are rare.Madrona is our attempt to change that.
										A place where you can:	Come alone or with friends
										Read feminist and lesbian books
										Have a coffee, then a drink, then maybe another
										Exist without explaining yourself
										Feel safe, relaxed, and at home
										It’s not just a bar. It’s a living room for the community.
										How you can help
										Donate if you can
										Share this page with your friends, group chats, and aunties
										Offer skills, tools, or practical help if that’s more your thing
										Every euro helps. Truly.
										You’re not just paying for pipes and cables. You’re helping create a space we can actually gather in.
										Thank you for supporting Laise Bien and believing this space should exist.
										We promise good vibes, good books, and very gay drinks.
